/* 
Polyfill -
 are the JS code or implementation, to support the features that are not supported
  by the older browser.
 Suppose features like map,filter, Math.abs, reduce which sre part of ES6 might not work as expected in older browser
 SO polyfills helps to bridge the gap.
 Means we will write the code to make that feature work i older browser.

 However the polyfils are not used extensively, for better performanceand better functionality.
 - Native implementations of APIS can do much more and faster than polyfills.
 
 -- Polyfills is script that adds modern features to older browsers , that don't support them.
 -- Polyfills are often used alongside transpilers like Babel to convert modern code into 
 a backward-compatible format.
